The objective of this dissertation is to assess whether urban environments
have a higher prevalence of antidepressant prescriptions compared to rural
environments. This research is carried out using publicly available 2014 National Health Service (NHS) prescription data, National Postcode Lookup(NPL) and 2011 Output Area Classification (OAC) data for analysis. 

Prescription numbers are identified for each of the different Supergroups which
define whether an Output Area is under the urban or rural label. An increased
rate of antidepressant prescriptions can be identified for urban areas when
compared to rural ones. 

The Poisson regression model that is implemented
provided statistically significant coefficient values for prescription rates. Time
series analysis of monthly prescription counts showed an identifiable seasonal
trend for all Supergroups. The trends, when compared for rural and urban
Supergroups, showed no difference in trend or seasonality. This suggested that
while urban and rural prescription counts differed significantly, their overall
rate counts followed a similar trend throughout the year.
